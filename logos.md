Logos can be added/updated by creating/modifying a PNG file entity with the proper slug in: `Sidebar Menu > CMS > Files`

Each UI app (Admin and Portal) has two logo entities; one appears in the login page and the other appears in the page header within the app.

#### Login page logo
- Admin slug: admin-logo-login
- Portal slug: portal-logo-login
- Size restrictions: The maximum width of the logo is restricted to 255px and its height is scale in proportion to its width.

#### Header logo
- Admin slug: admin-logo-header
- Portal slug: portal-logo-header
- Size restrictions: The maximum width of the logo is restricted to 255px (256px for small devices), its maximum height is restricted to 60px, and its height is scale in proportion to its width.

It's recommended to upload logos with larger dimensions (about 510px in width) to improve rendering quality as they get scaled down based on their aspect ratio.
